# Handwritten Character Recognition Project

## Introduction:
This project aims to recognize handwritten characters using machine learning techniques. The dataset used contains images of handwritten characters from A to Z. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict the character represented by a given handwritten image.

## Dataset:
The dataset used for this project consists of images of handwritten characters from A to Z. Each image is grayscale and has a size of 28x28 pixels. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the model's performance.

## Preprocessing:
The dataset is loaded and split into features (images) and labels (character labels).
The images are reshaped to match the input shape required by the convolutional neural network (CNN).
Data augmentation techniques such as shuffling and thresholding are applied to enhance model robustness.

## Model Architecture:
The model architecture consists of convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers to extract features from the images.
The flattened output is passed through dense layers with rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation functions.
The final layer uses a softmax activation function to predict the probability distribution over the 26 classes (A to Z).

## Training and Evaluation:
The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.
Training is performed on the training dataset with validation on the testing dataset.
Model performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics on the testing dataset.

## Model Deployment:
The trained model is saved for future use.
For demonstration purposes, a script is provided to load the saved model and perform character recognition on new handwritten images.

## Technologies Used:
Python
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras
Future Improvements:
Explore advanced neural network architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with deeper layers for improved performance.
Fine-tune hyperparameters and experiment with different optimization techniques to enhance model accuracy.
Integrate the model into web or mobile applications for real-time character recognition.
